A way of solving linear systems by the process of the system in Matrix form, then reducing the matrix down such that its possible to isolate all the variables or make the system easier to solve

The system like $${2x+3y=7}\brace{x-y=1}$$
	can be written as 
	$$\begin{bmatrix}
x\\ y
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 3 \\
1 & -1
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
7 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}$$
the main matrix itself can be written in augmented form like
$$\begin{matrix}{}

\end{matrix}$$
