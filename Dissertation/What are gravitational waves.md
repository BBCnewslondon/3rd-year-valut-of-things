They are consequences of the idea of general relativity.
Prior to Einstein, the prevailing description of gravity was Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation. In the Newtonian framework, gravity is a force that acts instantaneously across any distance, a concept known as "action at a distance". If the Sun were to vanish, its gravitational influence on Earth would cease at the same moment. This instantaneous nature is incompatible with Einstein's special theory of relativity (1905), which established the speed of light.

at the speed we now as $c$ or $\approx3\times 10^8$ 
General Relativity resolved this conflict by fundamentally redefining gravity. Instead of a force propagating through a static, passive background, GR describes gravity as an intrinsic property of spacetime itself. Mass and energy tell spacetime how to curve, and the curvature of spacetime tells mass and energy how to move. In this view, spacetime is a dynamic, four-dimensional fabric. A passing gravitational wave is a propagating disturbance—a "ripple"—in the curvature of this fabric, analogous to how an accelerating electric charge produces electromagnetic waves that propagate through the electromagnetic field. These ripples travel outward from their source at the speed of light, carrying energy and information about the cataclysmic events that created them.

## Creation of gravitational waves
While any accelerating mass technically generates gravitational waves, the effect is extraordinarily weak. The coupling of mass to spacetime curvature is governed by the gravitational constant, $G \approx 6.67\times 10^{-11}$, a very small number. As a result, detectable gravitational waves are produced only by the most massive objects in the universe undergoing the most extreme accelerations. The prime sources are  systems involving compact objects like neutron stars and black holes, which concentrate enormous mass into small volumes **AND** can orbit each other at relativistic speeds before merging.

A crucial requirement for the emission of gravitational waves is asymmetry. A perfectly spherically symmetric system, even one that is pulsating radially, will not radiate gravitational waves. This is because the gravitational field of such an object, according to Birkhoff's theorem, is static outside the body. Gravitational radiation is generated by a time-varying _quadrupole moment_ of the mass-energy distribution. This can be visualized as a change in the "ellipticity" of the system. A spinning, non-axisymmetric neutron star (one with a "mountain" on its surface) or, more dramatically, a pair of compact objects orbiting their common center of mass, possesses a rapidly changing quadrupole moment and thus radiates gravitational waves powerfully.  

This quadrupolar nature is a fundamental distinction from electromagnetism, where the dominant form of radiation is dipolar, produced by an oscillating electric dipole. In gravity, the equivalent of a mass dipole moment is related to the center of mass, and its first time derivative is the total momentum of the system. Due to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of an isolated system is constant, meaning its second time derivative is zero. Consequently, there is no gravitational dipole radiation. The lowest-order form of radiation permitted by the conservation laws in General Relativity is quadrupolar, a direct and testable consequence of GR being a tensor theory of gravity. This tensor nature also dictates that the waves have two independent polarization states, conventionally called "plus" (+) and "cross" (×), which describe the distinct patterns of stretching and squeezing they impart on spacetime.

## Multipole expansion
This expansion is mainly used as a way to simplify complicated fields. For this case in order to get the multipole expansion to describe the mass distribution.
