They are consequences of the idea of general relativity.
Prior to Einstein, the prevailing description of gravity was Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation. In the Newtonian framework, gravity is a force that acts instantaneously across any distance, a concept known as "action at a distance". If the Sun were to vanish, its gravitational influence on Earth would cease at the same moment. This instantaneous nature is incompatible with Einstein's special theory of relativity (1905), which established the speed of light.

at the speed we now as $c$ or $\approx3\times 10^8$ 
General Relativity resolved this conflict by fundamentally redefining gravity. Instead of a force propagating through a static, passive background, GR describes gravity as an intrinsic property of spacetime itself. Mass and energy tell spacetime how to curve, and the curvature of spacetime tells mass and energy how to move. In this view, spacetime is a dynamic, four-dimensional fabric. A passing gravitational wave is a propagating disturbance—a "ripple"—in the curvature of this fabric, analogous to how an accelerating electric charge produces electromagnetic waves that propagate through the electromagnetic field. These ripples travel outward from their source at the speed of light, carrying energy and information about the cataclysmic events that created them.
