These are just shorthand's for functions. The same way the $+,-,\cdot,/$ are operators for standard numbers. 
The operators in quantum mechanics are applied to the wave functions $\Psi(x,t)$ 
These operators would include

---
## The position operator
This is denoted as $\hat{x}$ 
all this operator does is multiplying the wave function by its position
$\Psi(x,t)\hat{x}=\Psi(x,t)\cdot x$

This operator would end up telling you the position of the wavefunction

---
## The momentum operator

This denoted as $\hat{p}$
This is shorthand for finding the derivative of the position of the wavefunction and then multiplying it by the constant $-ih$. This constant is there to make sure that the operator is [[Hermitian]]

$\Psi(x,t)\hat{p_{x}}=ih\cdot \frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial x}$
